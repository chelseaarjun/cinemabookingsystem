#Design considerations
1. Objects/Entities -
    1.1 Seats
        - seatID: String
        - isReserved: Boolean
        - reserveSeats(List<Seat> seats)
        - getReserverdSeats()
        - geFreeSeats
        - getAllSeats()
        
    1.2 Ticket 
        - ticketID: string
        - seats: array[Seats]
        - generateNewTicketID()

    1.3 ReservationSystem
        - reserverTickets(int numSeats)
        - confirmSeatSelection(array[]: Seats)
        - checkBooking()
        - main()
          
#Assumptions
- No two users are using the system as the same time (there will be conflict as they both might get a reservation number with same seats)
- The system is only making a booking a single movie. So we don't need a movie object to keep track of the movies playing at a theater and their showtimes.
- Even for the single movie there is no showtimes selection needed.
